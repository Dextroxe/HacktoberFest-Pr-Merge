# About
I have noticed that there is not a proper repository for the students to refer for solution to the Competitive Programming contests. The online solution in various platforms are not trustworthy enough to be referenced as good sources. I request the viewer if he/she is on journey on being a great competitive programmer, then please contribute his/her accepted solutions and help us in making a proper repository for the same. You will find various programming languages and solutions to various competitive problems solved by contributors in various sites. In future it will also contain a Database of all the possible question asked in gate and interview round.üî•

## ‚úÖInstructions to Contibute in this repository

It should be noted that the notes for language should only include the instructions for the use of the language only and some basic guide tackling some simple problems .The language should have a index of its own . It should include DSA logic in the "DSA" folder only the DSA solution for that problem should be added in the relevant DSA topics `TOPICS_NAME.md` file only. Existing algorithm should not be recreated.
